# Ad-mailer

A small project being able to scrape websites such as www.blocket.se (similar to Craigslist) looking for relevant ads and sending emails to the user if an ad appears that meets the users criterion.

**Example of usage**: I created the script when moving to a new city, looking to rent a room in a shared apartment. Using this program, I would be notified when a new room was listed within my price range so that I could quickly respond if it was of interest to me. After a few days of running this script on a Raspberry Pi, I had managed to find an apartment.
